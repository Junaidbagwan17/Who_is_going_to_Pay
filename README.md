Hey Freinds!, 

In This Project, i created a program based on trending topic which being happened on social media, because we know that when the friends come together they will surely go for party .
when they go to the party else for dinner and having a meal all friends used to target that freind who dosent pay💸 at all whenvever they plan to go out, to detect this kinds of issues 😁,
they give cards to the owner or someone who dont know our names and whos card to pick and which one to pick at their on choice randomly, he/she radomly picks a card and the person will pay the bill who's name is written in the card picked by owner/X-person.✔️
